<p>Note that before you begin this assignment you should already have
read and understand the issues discussed within the Assignment #0
document that is passed out in class and available on the class Web
site. </p>
<h2>Part 1: the Hybrid VIdeo #1<br>
1 Printout, 20 Points</h2>
<p>For this part of the assignment, you are asked to watch, listen, and
do the same steps as are done in the hybrid video. The links to this
hybrid video appear below (both Windows Media and Flash versions). But
before you attempt to access this video, you should first read the
"About Hybrid Videos" document so you are sure to be experiencing the
video as it was intended. </p>
<p>Link to the Windows Media video (8MB .wmv file): <a href="http://faculty.rcc.edu/mcleod/html/videos/xhtml_video_1_intro.wmv">Hybrid Video #1</a> (43 min, 20 sec video) </p>
<p>Link to the Flash version of this video: <a href="http://faculty.rcc.edu/mcleod/html/flash/xhtml_video_1_intro.html">Flash Hybrid Video #1</a></p>
<p>By doing what the video does, you will be creating an HTML online
resume document from scratch. There are no files that you need to have
as a starting point for this part. The document that you create,
"resume.htm", should be saved on any disk and folder that you like and
should be identical to the document created in the video except that
you should insert your own first and last name in place of "Joe
Student" wherever they appear in the video. </p>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #1:</span> Turn in a printout of the
finished document, (after your name has been inserted as directed
above), printed from within the browser (using the browser's File
menu). Your printout should look like the one shown at the end of the
video except for your name. </p>
<h2>Part 2: Your Own Resume<br>
  2 Printouts, 20 points </h2>
<p>Copy your resume.htm file from part 1 of this assignment, calling
the new copy myresume.htm. Then make the following changes to this Web
page to customized for you. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Modify the contact information paragraph to reflect your own address, email, and phone. </li>
  <li>Rewrite
the Objective section to indicate that you are looking for a particular
job position within a particular industry. Choose a type of job that
you are actually interested in.</li>
  <li>Modify the Interests
section to list 3 of your own actual interests (instead of the original
2). Modify the list structure to display these 3 interests as an
ordered list (1, 2, 3) instead of a bulleted list. </li>
  <li>Adjust
the Education section to be an unordered list. Modify the list items so
that they reflect actual information about your own educational
history. If you do not have any degrees or certificates yet, just
indicate what you are working toward currently at RCC, your educational
goals, your (intended) major, extra activities on campus, and/or
classes you are taking or have taken. You should end up with at least 2
bulleted education list items. </li>
  <li>Adjust the Experience
section to indicate at least 2 jobs that you have either actually had
previously or, if you do not have the experience, that you make up.
Format the section using the same structure of tags that is in the
original page.</li>
  <li>Modify the References section to replace the
existing 2 people with two new ones based on your new experience
section. You are encouraged to make up 2 people with humorous names and
job titles. But let's keep it clean folks -- remember, this class is
rated PG-13!</li>
  <li>In an HTML comment section within the "head" section of your code, indicate that this is "Assignment #1, Part #2". </li>
</ol>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #2:</span> Turn in a printout of
your new resume document, (after your name has been inserted as
directed above), printed from within the browser (using the browser's
File menu.) </p>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #3:</span> Turn in a printout of the
HTML code for this same document, printed from within Notepad (or
whatever text editor you are using.)</p>
<h2>Part 3: Tutorial 1, Developing a  Web Page<br>
   2 Printouts, 20 Points</h2>
<p>Read and do the steps and instructions given within tutorial 1 on
pages 1 - 47 of the textbook (you should not do any work after page
47). In completing this tutorial you will create the "Dave's Devil
Sticks" Web page exactly as shown in the book except for the following
changes. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the document's second paragraph of text, the indented
testimonial area which reads "I'm more than happy to recommend...". On
the line below this paragraph, <strong>locate the name "Thomas Gage" and replace it with  your own full name</strong>.
Make sure that the rest of that line remains the same, including the
em-dash and space before your name and the comma after it. </li>
  <li>Also make sure that your full name shows up in the comment area of the HTML code, as indicated on page 14 in figure 1-7.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #4:</span> Turn in a printout of the finished 
  document, (after your name has been inserted as directed above), printed from 
  within the browser (using the browser's File menu). Your printout should look like the one 
  shown in figure 1-41 on page 47 (except for  your name.) </p>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #5:</span> Turn in a printout of the
HTML code for this same document, printed from within Notepad (or
whatever text editor you are using). The printout should look something
like the HTML document shown in figure 1-40 on page 46 of your textbook
(except that figure is just a partial view of the file.) Make sure your
name shows up in the code in the 2 areas mentioned above.</p>

<h2>Part 4: the Hybrid VIdeo #2: Links<br>
1 Printout, 20 Points</h2>
<p>For this part of the assignment, you are asked to watch, listen, and
do the same steps as are done in the hybrid video. The links to this
hybrid video appear below. But before you attempt to access this video,
you should first read the "About Hybrid Videos" document so you are
sure to be experiencing the video as it was intended. If the video link
doesn't start the video when clicked, try right-clicking and saving the
target to download the file and then try playing it locally. </p>
<p>By doing what the video does, you will be creating a "Favorite
Links" page. But you are not asked to create this page from scratch. To
follow along with the video's steps, you will need to have a set of
starter files ready for your own use. The links to this hybrid video
and to these data files appear below. But before you attempt to access
this video or its data files, you should first read the "About Hybrid
Videos" document (and the section entitled "Getting The Data Files For
The Video") so you are sure to be experiencing the video as it was
intended. </p>
<p>Link to the data files (.zip file): <a href="http://faculty.rcc.edu/mcleod/html/videos/xhtml_video_2_links.zip">Data files for Video #2</a></p>
<p>Link to the Windows Media video: <a href="http://faculty.rcc.edu/mcleod/html/videos/xhtml_video_2_links.wmv">Hybrid Video #2</a> (12.6MB .wmv file, 50 min 32 sec video)</p>
<p>Link to the Flash version of this video: <a href="http://faculty.rcc.edu/mcleod/html/flash/xhtml_video_2_links.html">Flash Hybrid Video #2</a></p>
<p>The document that you create, "links.htm", should be exactly like
the document created in the video except that you should insert your
own first and last name in place of "Joe Student" wherever they appear
(in the title and h1) and insert your email address instead of Joe
Student's in the "Contact Me" section. You should also insert a typical
html comment area toward the top of the file to identify yourself, the
class you are in, the day/time it meets, and your instructor. </p>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #6:</span> Turn in a printout of the
completed favorite links document, (after your name has been inserted
as directed above), printed from within the browser (using the
browser's File menu). Your printout should look like the one shown in
the video except for the changes mentioned above (your name and email).
</p>
<h2>Part 5: ADD Your Own Links<br>
  2 Printouts, 20 Points</h2>
<p>For this part of the assignment, you are asked to finish part 4's
favorite links page. You will be adding some of your own favorite
links. You may have noticed a sample of a completed "Favorite Links"
page toward the beginning of the hybrid video. Although that sample had
the correct layout and formatting, you are going to be adding your own
personal favorite links and link categories, so yours will be
different. Below are the guidelines and requirements for completing
this page. Follow them closely to maximize your points.</p>
<h4>Guidelines</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Copy your links.htm file (from the hybrid video) and call
the new file mylinks.htm. Then open mylinks.htm in your editor of
choice and modify this new file as follows. </li>
  <li>Make sure
that the "Contact Info" section displays your own email address as the
underlined link in the browser and also addresses the email to you when
that link is clicked.</li>
  <li>Note that all of the links that you
add to this document must be your own unique ones -- not copied from
mine or another student's favorite links page. </li>
  <li>Add 2 more
h2 category sections above the current "HTML Resources" section (but
below the bullet list of links). Examples of possible categories are
"Games" (for gaming sites), "Shopping" (for e-commerce sites), "Sports"
(for sports related sites), "Movies" (for movie related sites), etc.</li>
  <li>Place
at least two appropriate links within each of these two new categories.
The link descriptions should be about as detailed as the existing ones
from the video. Use the same HTML coding format (definition lists) for
these links as was used for the ones in the video. Test your links --
they must work! </li>
  <li>Insert two more "Top of page" image links for these new sections, using the same image and alignment used in the video.</li>
  <li>After
your two new categories and links are in place, then insert your two
new category names at the beginning of the existing bulleted list as
follows: <ul>
        <li>These links should scroll the browser down to
the heading for that category. To test these links, shrink the browser
height and/or width as needed (as was done in the video.) </li>
        <li>These links should match the exact wording of the category headings themselves (such as the "Search Engines" link does.)</li>
        <li>The
order of these 5 bulleted links should match the order of the link
sections themselves as they appear down the page (from top to bottom). </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #7:</span> Turn in a printout of the
completed "Favorite Links" page, printed from within the browser using
the browser's "File" menu. The whole page must display (it is ok if it
takes more than one sheet of paper).</p>
<p><span class="printout">Printout #8:</span> Turn in a printout of the
HTML code for this same document, printed from within your text editor
(such as Notepad). Make sure that all of your code prints (it is ok if
it takes more than one sheet of paper).</p>
<h2>Part 6: A Cover sheet<br>
  1 Printout, 0 Points</h2>
<p>For this part of the assignment, you are asked to create a quick
word processing document that contains the following information in a
large font. You will attach a document like this to the front of each
of your assignments in this class to help identify what assignment it
is and that it is your work. Here are the guidelines for creating this
word processing (not a html) document. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The first line should look like the line below, with your own name replacing Joe Student's. <br>
  Name: Joe Student </li>
  <li>The second line should look like the line below.<br>
    Class: CIS-72A</li>
  <li>The third line should look like the line below, with your own class' day and time.<br>
    Meets: Wednesdays @10:30</li>
  <li>The fourth line should look like the line below.<br>
Assignment: #1</li>
  <li>The fifth line should look like the line below.<br>
  Instructor: Scott McLeod</li>
</ol>


<p><span class="printout">Printout #9:</span> Turn in a printout of
your word processing document. Staple this cover sheet on top of all of
your other printouts. That way it will identify your work when you turn
it in.<br>
