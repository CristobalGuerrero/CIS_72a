Video Game Backround
</h1>
<p>Well my background in gaming mostly partakes in mmorpg's or simulated ones. An mmorpg stands for a multi-mass online role playing game. Yeah thats a mouthful so mmorpg is a whole lot better then saying all that at one time. There is a good list of those mmo's that are quite popular these days such as <i>World Of War Craft</i> though the one I play is from Dev Cat which is distributed online by Nexon that is called Mabinogi. The game consist constant levelig and skill building. You can go to the light side or the infamous dark side. Mainly because the dark side has cookies. Not really though they tend to have greater boost in power and have more potential to grow in stats. I myself have been playing for about 1.5 years now and I am pretty well known with the mass of people who play. I am currently at a very high level which I can complete many quest for people. I am also working on the 8th generation of the game.</p></td>
